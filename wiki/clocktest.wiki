#summary Used to determine the accuracy of the Rainbowduino's clock.

Used to determine the accuracy of the Rainbowduino's clock.
Every 10 seconds, `clocktest` will tell you how long it took to send
a message and get a response, and how much the Rainbowduino's clock
has shifted relative to the PC's clock.

This information can be used with the `SET_CLOCK_ADJUST` command
to give more accurate time. The `SET_CLOCK_ADJUST` command takes
the number of milliseconds it takes for the Rainbowduino to lose
or gain a millisecond. If your Rainbowduino's clock is running
fast, a negative number will slow the clock down; if the clock is
running slow, a positive number will speed the clock up.

|| `-p` _path_ || Specifies the path to the serial port device. Can also be specified with the environment variable `ARDUINO_PORT`. ||
|| `-b` _baud_ || Specifies the baud or bit rate used to communicate with the serial port. Defaults to 9600. Can also be specified with the environment variable `ARDUINO_BITRATE`. ||
|| `-c` _msec_ || Runs the clock test with the specified value for `SET_CLOCK_ADJUST`. ||
