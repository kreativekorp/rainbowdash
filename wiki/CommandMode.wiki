#summary CommandMode is a rewrite of the standard command-mode firmware.

CommandMode is a rewrite of the standard command-mode firmware.

Commands have the following format:

|| `52` || the header, an ASCII 'R' ||
|| `cc` || the command number ||
|| `sr` || the column number; the red channel ||
|| `gb` || the green channel; the blue channel ||
|| `ii` || the image number, ASCII value, or row number ||

The following commands are supported:

|| `52 01 s0 00 ii` || `SHOW_IMAGE` || Displays a hard-coded image. ||
|| `52 02 sr gb ii` || `SHOW_CHARACTER` || Displays an 8x8 ASCII character. ||
|| `52 03 0r gb 00` || `SHOW_COLOR` || Displays a solid color. ||
|| `52 04 sr gb ii` || `SHOW_PIXEL` || Sets an individual pixel on the display. ||

CommandMode has all the same restrictions as the standard firmware:
only five built-in images, only letters and digits, and only the commands
listed above. The only extra is the `SHOW_PIXEL` command, as it is a common
modification, and the Rainbowduino is close to useless without it.
