#summary CommandMode is a rewrite of the standard command-mode firmware.

CommandMode is a rewrite of the standard command-mode firmware provided
for Rainbowduino 2.0. It works only with Rainbowduino 2.0.

!CommandMode3 is similar firmware for Rainbowduino 3.0. It works only
with Rainbowduino 3.0. !CommandMode3 and original CommandMode use the
same command format and are compatible with each other.

Commands have the following format:

|| `52` || the header, an ASCII 'R' ||
|| `cc` || the command number ||
|| `sr` || the column number; the red channel ||
|| `gb` || the green channel; the blue channel ||
|| `ii` || the image number, ASCII value, or row number ||

The following commands are supported:

|| `52 01 s0 00 ii` || `SHOW_IMAGE` || Displays a hard-coded image. ||
|| `52 02 sr gb ii` || `SHOW_CHARACTER` || Displays an 8x8 ASCII character. ||
|| `52 03 0r gb 00` || `SHOW_COLOR` || Displays a solid color. ||
|| `52 04 sr gb ii` || `SHOW_PIXEL` || Sets an individual pixel on the display. ||

CommandMode and !CommandMode3 have all the same restrictions the standard
firmware provided for Rainbowduino 2.0 had: only five built-in images,
only letters and digits, and only the commands listed above. The only
extra is the `SHOW_PIXEL` command, as it is a common modification, and
the Rainbowduino is close to useless without it.
