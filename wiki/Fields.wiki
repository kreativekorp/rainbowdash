#summary When the high bit of the control channel is set, the control channel is treated as a field number.

When the high bit of the control channel is set, the
control channel is treated as a field number.

Fields 64-127 are determined by 32 user-controlled registers.
Fields 64-95 are equivalent to fields 96-127. (Earlier versions
of RainbowDashboard had 64 registers, but newer versions have
only 32 because of increasing memory requirements.)

Fields 0-63 are the following time values:
