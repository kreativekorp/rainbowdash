#summary RainbowStudio is a graphical front-end application for controlling Rainbowduinos.

RainbowStudio is a graphical front-end application for controlling
Rainbowduinos. Using RainbowStudio, you can upload firmware without
the Arduino IDE, drive a display, emulate a virtual Rainbowduino,
and edit RBD (RainbowDashboard command stream) files.

RainbowStudio comes in a standard Mac OS X application bundle,
accompanied with a standard Windows executable wrapper, or in a
JAR file, depending on platform. No installation is necessary;
just launch the appropriate executable.

When you launch RainbowStudio, the RainbowStudio control panel window
will open. From here, you can do several things:

  * [RainbowStudioUpload Upload any of six included firmwares to a Rainbowduino.]
  * [RainbowStudioConnect Connect to a Rainbowduino and drive a display.]
  * [RainbowStudioEmulate Open a virtual Rainbowduino and drive it as you would a real Rainbowduino.]
  * [RainbowStudioEdit Create and edit RBD files and display them on a real or virtual Rainbowduino.]
