  * [becho]: A general-purpose utility that simply writes its arguments back to standard output.
  * [aecho]: A utility similar to becho that instead writes its output to a serial port.

  * [clocktest]: Used to determine the accuracy of the Rainbowduino's clock.
  * [rainbowd]: A background process that creates a named pipe and copies anything written to the pipe to the Rainbowduino's serial port.
  * [rainbowclock]: A background process that updates the Rainbowduino's clock every hour.
  * [rainbowmoodlight]: A background process that drives a constantly-changing display of random colors on the Rainbowduino.
