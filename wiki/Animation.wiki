#summary Animations are accomplished using two additional separate data areas.

Animations are accomplished using two additional separate data areas.

The Animation Data area contains 256 actual frame-by-frame color levels.
To set these levels, the `SET_ANIM_DATA_1`, `2`, `3`, and `4` commands are used:

|| `SET_ANIM_DATA_1` || `72 18 00 aa v1 00 00 00` || `aa` is the address where `v1` will be stored. ||
|| `SET_ANIM_DATA_2` || `72 19 00 aa v1 v2 00 00` || `aa` is the address where `v1` will be stored; `v2` will be stored at the following address. ||
|| `SET_ANIM_DATA_3` || `72 1A 00 aa v1 v2 v3 00` || `aa` is the address where `v1` will be stored; `v2` will be stored at the following address, and `v3` after that. ||
|| `SET_ANIM_DATA_4` || `72 1B 00 aa v1 v2 v3 v4` || `aa` is the address where `v1` will be stored; `v2` will be stored at the following address, then `v3`, then `v4`. ||

The Animation Info area contains 64 animation slots, each of which
determines the address of the animation loop within the Animation Data
area, the number of frames in the loop, the offset to the first frame
(relative to the address), and the duration of each frame. An animation
slot is set using the `SET_ANIM_INFO` command:

|| `SET_ANIM_INFO` || `72 17 00 ss aa ll oo dd` || `ss` is the slot number. `aa` is the address. `ll` is the number of frames. `oo` is the offset of frame 1. `dd` is the duration of a frame. ||

The duration of a frame is expressed in hundredths of a second; the longest
possible duration is 2.55 seconds.
