#summary A general-purpose utility that simply writes its arguments back to standard output.

A general-purpose utility that simply writes its arguments
back to standard output. Escape sequences (with a backslash)
are decoded (see EscapeSequences), but otherwise
arguments are left untouched. No options are supported for
this command; they end up written to standard output just like
all other arguments. No spaces are written between arguments,
and no newlines are written at the end. The 'b' in `becho`
stands for 'binary.'
