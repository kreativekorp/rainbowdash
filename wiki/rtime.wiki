#summary Prints the current time as the four values that define the current time as kept by the software real-time clock in RainbowDashboard.

Prints the current time as days since January 1, 1970, UTC;
milliseconds since midnight, UTC; time zone offset from UTC
in milliseconds; and daylight saving time offset from UTC
in milliseconds. These four values define the current time
as kept by the software real-time clock in RainbowDashboard.

|| `-d` || Prints the four values as decimal integers; the default. ||
|| `-h` || Prints the four values as 8-digit hexadecimal integers. ||
|| `-b` || Outputs the four values as 32-bit big-endian binary data. ||
|| `-r` || Outputs the four values as a series of RainbowDashboard commands that set the clock on the Rainbowduino. ||
|| `-f` || Outputs the current values of all 64 individual clock fields. See [Fields]. ||

You can set the clock on the Rainbowduino by simply redirecting
the output of `rtime -r` to the Rainbowduino's serial port using
[aecho] or [rainbowd]. The 'r' in `rtime` stands for 'Rainbowduino.'
