== Using RainbowStudio to emulate a virtual Rainbowduino ==

  # Select a virtual device from the *Device* menu. (There is no need to independently select a protocol from the *Protocol* menu, since the virtual device knows which command set it implements. There is also no need to enter a latency or clock adjustment factor, since the virtual device will simply ignore it.)
  # Press the *Connect* button (or select *Connect to Device* from the *File* menu). The emulator will open in a separate window, then the bottom half of the control panel (the activity panel) will open up.
