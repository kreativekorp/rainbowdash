#summary A utility similar to becho that instead writes its output to a serial port.

A utility similar to `becho` that instead writes its output
to a serial port. Unlike `becho`, `aecho` takes options:

|| `-p` _path_ || Specifies the path to the serial port device. Can also be specified with the environment variable `ARDUINO_PORT`. ||
|| `-b` _baud_ || Specifies the baud or bit rate used to communicate with the serial port. Defaults to 9600. Can also be specified with the environment variable `ARDUINO_BITRATE`. ||
|| `-m` _num_ _str_ || Writes the specified string the specified number of times. ||
|| `-i` || Writes standard input to the serial port. ||
|| `-f` _path_ || Writes the contents of a file to the serial port. ||
|| `-rl` || Reads data back from the serial port until a newline and writes it back to standard output. ||
|| `-rm` || Reads data back from the serial port until a carriage return and writes it back to standard output. ||
|| `-rn` || Reads data back from the serial port until a null byte and writes it back to standard output. ||
|| `-ra` || Reads any and all data back from the serial port and writes it back to standard output. ||
|| `-rf` _len_ || Reads the specified number of bytes back from the serial port and writes it back to standard output. ||
|| `-rb` || Reads a single byte back from the serial port and writes it back to standard output. ||
|| `-d` _msec_ || Waits the specified number of milliseconds before processing the next argument. ||
|| `-o` || Opens the serial port before anything has been written. ||
|| `-c` || Closes the serial port before all arguments have been processed. ||
|| `-n` || If nothing has been written, exit immediately instead of writing standard input to the serial port. ||

If no data is written to the serial port using the arguments to
`aecho`, standard input will be written instead, unless the `-n` option
is specified. The 'a' in `aecho` stands for 'arduino.'
